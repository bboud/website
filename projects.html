						<a href="https://github.com/bboud/graphics"><b>Graphics</b></a> is an attempt to create a 3D engine that can perform mathematics and physics simulations. For a long time, I have been interested in being able to program 3D graphics. This is a long-term project that I work on when I have a neat idea!

						<a href="https://github.com/bboud/warden"><b>Warden</b></a> is an overhaul of a previous project that provides visual/audio alerts for severe weather events in multiple programmable locations. This was born out of my desire to monitor multiple locations of friends and family. Having a convenient piece of hardware on my desk that can alert me of tornado warnings and more helps me inform my family and friends faster. <br><br> At the moment, I am writing a driver for an I2C OLED display to give more context to certain events. My long-term plan is to get a PCB made and 3D-Print a case. Currently, the code is running on a Raspberry Pi, but I will eventually re-write the code for a microcontroller so it can be plug-n-play! <br><br>This is part 1 of a multi-part weather system that relies on satellite communication instead of the internet.

						Since getting a 3D printer, I have been making and painting <b>miniatures</b> for Dungeons and Dragons campaigns. 
						<br><br>
						This is a new hobby for me! I am very interested in printing more complex things such as cosplay weapons.
