						Hello! My name is Brandon Boudreaux. I am a 3rd-year Physics major with a minor in Mathematics at <a href="wayne.edu">Wayne State University</a> in Detroit, Michigan. I am the Treasurer of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WSUSPS"> Society of Physics Students Wayne State Chapter</a>. I was born in Norco, Louisiana, and relocated to the Detroit Metro Area in 2014. After I complete my degree, I hope to continue my education in a Ph.D. program in pursuit of physics.
						<br><br>
						Currently, I am an undergraduate research fellow of the <a href="https://jetscape.org/">JETSCAPE Collaboration</a> developing machine learning replacement for quark-gluon plasma hydrodynamics simulations. View the 'Research' tab for more information!
						<br><br>
						I have a wide variety of interests that include, but are not limited to Video games, Meteorology, Mathematics, Physics, Electronics, 3D-Printing, Programming, Language Learning, Climate Activism, and much more! The 'Projects' tab includes a list of projects that are currently in the works.

						<a href="https://github.com/bboud/graphics"><b>Graphics</b></a> is an attempt to create a 3D engine that can perform mathematics and physics simulations. For a long time, I have been interested in being able to program 3D graphics. This is a long-term project that I work on when I have a neat idea!

						<a href="https://github.com/bboud/warden"><b>Warden</b></a> is an overhaul of a previous project that provides visual/audio alerts for severe weather events in multiple programmable locations. This was born out of my desire to monitor multiple locations of friends and family. Having a convenient piece of hardware on my desk that can alert me of tornado warnings and more helps me inform my family and friends faster. <br><br> At the moment, I am writing a driver for an I2C OLED display to give more context to certain events. My long-term plan is to get a PCB made and 3D-Print a case. Currently, the code is running on a Raspberry Pi, but I will eventually re-write the code for a microcontroller so it can be plug-n-play! <br><br>This is part 1 of a multi-part weather system that relies on satellite communication instead of the internet.

						Since getting a 3D printer, I have been making and painting <b>miniatures</b> for Dungeons and Dragons campaigns. 
						<br><br>
						This is a new hobby for me! I am very interested in printing more complex things such as cosplay weapons.
